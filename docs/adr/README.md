## Conventions

- An ADR without a `Status` section is accepted as written.
- When a later ADR revises or replaces part of an earlier one, give the earlier ADR a `Status` section naming the reviser (see ADR 0002), and trim the superseded text instead of leaving it to mislead.
- Gaps in the sequence (0004–0008, 0010–0012, 0014, 0016–0017, 0020–0022, 0025–0026, 0029, 0031–0032, 0034, 0039–0041, 0043, 0045–0046, 0048–0049, 0051, 0060) are deleted ADRs — decisions superseded, merged, withdrawn, or absorbed into CONTEXT.md, code comments, and tests. 0017's decision (DB Service Restore creates a new DB Service) lives on as the CONTEXT.md definition; 0008's, 0016's, and 0034's modeling lives on in CONTEXT.md entries; 0048's snap-only width rule lives on as the pane-motion comment in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`; 0020's shared-UI boundary and 0049's DB Access state ownership were retired with their records.
- Rules that outlived their record live as comments at the gate that enforces them: 0021's and 0022's placement persistence in `layout/patch.ts` and `layout/global-placement.ts`, 0040's measured footprints in `layout/placement-node.ts`, 0041's node-identity comparison in `canvas/canvas.node-merge.ts`, and 0031's submission ownership in `resource-settings/settings-submissions.ts`.
