# Domain Context

The ubiquitous language for the Brain product domain, grouped by area.

## Project & Navigation

### Project Display Name

The human-facing Project name shown in navigation and confirmation prompts, stored on the Brain Project record and unique within a namespace (trimmed, case-insensitive). It is not chosen at creation: the platform derives a default from the Deployment Task's Deployment Source (falling back to a readable random name) and resolves collisions for derived names itself, while an explicitly specified name is never silently altered — a collision is an error. Never a selector; stable identity uses Project ID.

_Avoid_: auto name, generated title.

### Project Aggregate Status

A derived health tone for one Project row in the project list, computed from the phases of the Project's APs and DBs — not a persisted field on the Project record. It expresses whether the workloads inside the project are healthy, which is distinct from whether the Project record itself exists.

### Pinned Project

A current-user navigation preference that marks one Project for prominent access in product navigation. A small user-curated shortcut set, not a shared Project property or a recent-projects list.

_Avoid_: Favorite Project, starred Project, recent Project.

### App Sidebar

The persistent left-edge product navigation surface containing product-level navigation, Project Shortcuts, and app-level actions. It is outside the Project Canvas and is not a Side Pane or a Project list.

_Avoid_: Project list, left Side Pane.

### Project Shortcut

A Project navigation entry in the App Sidebar: the current user's Pinned Projects plus at most one last-viewed unpinned Project. Not the complete Project list.

_Avoid_: Sidebar Project.

## AP & Application Workloads

### AP (Application)

A Brain product resource that represents an application workload. AP owns the application's desired compute, environment, App Listening Ports, Private Addresses, and Platform Address allocation requests.

### AP Workload Readiness

The condition where an AP's workload has enough running replicas to satisfy its AP Replica Strategy. Distinct from AP Public Access Health: public routing may still be progressing after the workload is ready.

### AP Replica Strategy

The AP configuration choice for how many workload replicas should run: either **Fixed Replicas** (one user-selected count the platform maintains) or **Elastic Scaling** (the platform adjusts replicas between user-selected bounds based on one resource utilization target).

### AP Configuration File

An AP-owned configuration file mounted into the application runtime through AP Settings: user-authored file content plus a mount path, not application-written data and not a standalone Settings Owner.

### AP Storage Mount

A persistent volume an AP owns at one absolute container path, keeping application-written data across restarts and redeploys. Mount paths are unique and fixed once created; capacity can grow but never shrink. Distinct from an AP Configuration File, which mounts user-authored content.

## AP Networking & Public Access

### App Listening Port

An AP container port where the application accepts traffic, identified by its unique port number within the AP. Each App Listening Port has one Private Address and may be targeted by zero or more Public Addresses.

### Private Address

A cluster-internal URL for an AP, derived from one App Listening Port. Once the port exists its Private Address is known — never model it as pending.

### Public Address

An externally reachable URL/domain alias for an AP that declares a target port and reaches the App Listening Port for that port. Its two kinds are Platform Address and Custom Domain; editing the target port is Public Address editing, not Custom Domain Binding.

### Platform Address

A system-assigned Public Address the platform creates without user DNS or certificate setup; users request one by choosing an App Listening Port, and its host may be pending until allocated. A Platform Address may be promoted into the CNAME target for a Custom Domain Binding. Its health reflects whether platform routing support matches the AP's public access intent — it does not wait on a separately reported load balancer address.

### Custom Domain

A user-owned Public Address that reaches an App Listening Port through a Custom Domain Binding; within one routing scope (v1: the Kubernetes namespace) a Custom Domain can belong to only one AP. Health is `verifying` while DNS ownership, certificates, or routing are still being established, and `blocked` only when the binding cannot proceed without a changed user or platform action.

### Custom Domain Binding

The relationship that attaches a Custom Domain to an AP by promoting one Platform Address as the CNAME target; the AP owns the binding intent and its public access health. The remembered fact that the domain pointed at the promoted address at submission time (CNAME Verification Evidence) belongs to the binding's intent lifecycle — it is not ongoing DNS monitoring. Unbinding returns the promoted Platform Address to ordinary display; it deletes nothing and does not close public access.

### AP Public Access Health

An AP-owned read-side assessment of each Public Address's routing readiness, using states such as `progressing`, `verifying`, `accessible`, and `blocked`. It is routing health, not application response monitoring: workload 404/500 responses do not make a Public Address unhealthy. An AP with no Public Address intent has no entries — absence of public access, not a blocked state.

_Avoid_: AP Public Access Node health, standalone public access monitor.

### AP Public Access Node

A presentation-only Project Canvas node derived from an AP's Public Addresses (user-visible label: Public access). Not a Brain product resource, backend API view, Kubernetes resource, or Settings Owner.

### AP Network Settings

The AP-owned settings area for App Listening Ports, Private Addresses, Public Addresses, Platform Addresses, and Custom Domain Bindings — one AP Settings Draft domain regardless of which Settings View shows it. Its public-routing section (the Domain List) lists Public Addresses with their routing state, and Public Address edits may add App Listening Ports within the same draft.

## Database

### DB (Database)

A Brain product resource that represents a managed database workload available to APs in the same Project.

### DB Service

The user-facing database service represented by one DB resource and one database node on the Project Canvas. A DB Service may expose multiple engine-level Logical Databases through DB Access.

### Logical Database

An engine-level database namespace inside one DB Service — a PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB database, or a Redis database index. An object browsed inside DB Access, not a Project Canvas DB resource.

### DB Instance Preset

A user-facing resource-size choice for DB Deployment Settings, each mapping to one DB quota value. Internal SKU-like labels such as `db.mysql.small` are not primary UI language.

### DB Service Backup

A named recovery point for an entire DB Service (manual or automatic), belonging to the service rather than one Logical Database. Deleting a backup removes only that recovery point, not the source service or anything restored from it.

### DB Service Backup Policy

The automatic backup rule for one DB Service — at most one current policy, defining schedule and retention, distinct from the backups it creates. Disabling it stops future automatic backups but deletes no existing DB Service Backups.

### DB Service Restore

A non-destructive workflow that creates a new DB Service from a completed DB Service Backup; the source service is never overwritten or rolled back. The restored service appears in the same Project and becomes the user's next Project Canvas focus.

### DB Access

A resource workflow for inspecting — and where the product enables it, editing — one DB Service's objects and data without exposing its connection credentials. Distinct from DB Settings, which changes desired configuration. Its workspace is browser-local and per service: switching to another DB Service ends the session and reopening starts fresh with no retained tabs; within one service an object has at most one open view, whose interaction state lasts only while its tab stays open.

_Avoid_: Database connection, DB Terminal session.

### System Object

A Logical Database object provisioned by the database engine, an installed extension, or platform operator tooling rather than authored by the user. Not part of the user's data model: DB Access omits System Objects by default and shows them only on explicit request.

_Avoid_: operator object, internal table, system table.

## Database Binding & AP Environment

### Database Binding

A runtime dependency where an AP is configured to consume one DB's connection credentials.

### Pending Database Binding Intent

An unsaved AP Environment draft intent to create or update a Database Binding, derived from explicit AP Environment References — never inferred from ordinary user-authored DSN strings. Multiple references from one draft to the same DB Service collapse into one intent, and an AP-to-DB Connecting Edge is only a shortcut for creating the same intent. It may appear as a pending canvas edge, but it is not a Canvas Connection until saved resource state contains binding evidence.

### AP Environment Raw Source

The canonical AP environment editing model: the complete set of entries as the user can author them in `.env` form, including direct values, AP Environment References, and runtime expansions. Structured environment controls are views or insertion aids over the raw source, not separate saved state.

### AP Environment Reference

A product-level expression in the AP Environment Raw Source that points at a DB Service-provided environment value. Resolved into ordinary entries before runtime, while the user-facing raw source may retain the expression.

### DB Connection DSN

A complete connection string for one DB Service, including any credentials the engine requires. Produced only by an explicit reveal or copy action — default DB read surfaces carry a DB Connection Template instead.

_Avoid_: credential-free DATABASE_URL.

### DB Connection Template

A credential-free connection string whose username and password segments are literal placeholders while address and database name are real. It identifies which DB Service a value points at without containing credentials, and is what DB read surfaces carry by default.

_Avoid_: masked DSN, redacted connection string.

## Settings

### Settings Owner

The resource whose desired configuration a settings surface edits — an AP or DB. Selecting an AP Public Access Node may open an AP-owned Settings View, but the node is never the Settings Owner.

### Settings Domain

A Settings Owner configuration partition that can be independently checked for conflicts, submitted as a Pending Settings Update, reconciled against observed resource state, and cleared when applied. Not a Settings Section, Settings View, or API field group.

### Settings View

A settings entry point presenting one named subset of a resource's settings surface, composed of one or more Settings Sections (coherent subsets of the owner's configuration). It remains part of that resource's settings surface and uses the same Settings Draft confirmation model as the full surface; neither views nor sections are standalone panes or Component Registry items.

### AP Settings

The primary UI surface for viewing and editing AP desired configuration, including image, resource capacity, Replica Strategy, environment, and network settings.

### DB Settings

The primary UI surface for viewing and editing an existing DB's desired configuration after it has been created.

### Settings Draft

A local set of pending AP or DB settings changes, submitted only when the user confirms the update. Discarding abandons the pending changes and keeps the settings surface open — it is not a cancellation of anything already submitted.

### Settings Submission

An in-flight settings write after the user confirms and before the product has accepted or rejected it. No longer an unsaved Settings Draft — the user may leave the settings surface — but not yet a Pending Settings Update.

### Pending Settings Update

A submitted settings change the product has accepted but the resource has not yet fully reflected. Leaving the surface warns about nothing; reopening presents the submitted target until the resource catches up or the user intentionally replaces it or adopts the latest observed configuration. It belongs to the Settings Owner and its Settings Domains, not the Settings View that submitted it — a narrow view and the full surface present the same target — and each domain's pending update clears independently as the resource catches up.

_Avoid_: saved draft, optimistic resource truth.

### Observed Settings Divergence

The condition where a domain's observed desired configuration changes to a value that is neither the submitted target nor what that target was submitted against. The user must choose to keep the submitted target or use the latest observed configuration — never an automatic overwrite.

## Authorization & Identity

### Workspace Actor

The verified human identity acting within a workspace namespace, established by cross-checking the request kubeconfig's live workspace access against the desktop-minted proof binding it to the global user id. Actor verification and namespace authorization are separate checks: one establishes who is acting, the other where that actor may act. A Desktop session user id, an unverified app-token claim, or a namespace-authorized workload ServiceAccount is not a Workspace Actor.

_Avoid_: Desktop user id, namespace member id.

## Deployment

### Deployment Task

A deploy workflow work unit for creating or changing Project resources from a Deployment Source into a Deployment Target, executed by one Deployment Runner and possibly producing Deployment Artifacts. Owned by the deployment domain, not by Chat: assistants may create or inspect tasks through tools, but the lifecycle, events, artifacts, and Deployment Task Timeline remain deployment records.

_Avoid_: deploy job, deployment request.

### Deployment Source

The user-provided origin or intent for a Deployment Task — a GitHub repository, Docker image, database choice, application template, or natural-language prompt. It describes what should be deployed, not where it lands.

### Deployment Target

The Project relationship selected before a Deployment Task starts: either a new Project created in the same flow or an existing Project that receives the deployed resources.

### Deployment Runner

The execution strategy for one Deployment Task: direct and template runners consume already-structured Deployment Sources, while an AI Runner interprets less-structured ones such as repositories or prompts.

### Deployment Artifact

A product resource description produced or selected by a Deployment Task for application into the Deployment Target — distinct from Deployment Source details and task progress messages.

### Deployment Task Cancel Request

A recorded user intent to stop an active Deployment Task, acknowledged cooperatively by the runner and resolved to `cancelled` by the engine when unacknowledged past its deadline. Cancelling stops the workflow; it never deletes or reverts applied resources.

_Avoid_: force kill, rollback, undo deployment.

### Redeploy

Recovery for a failed or cancelled Deployment Task: a new task cloned from the predecessor's Deployment Source and Deployment Target with recorded lineage, reusing result identities the predecessor already allocated. There is no in-place retry, and a GitHub Redeploy always binds the initiator's own GitHub Connection — it never inherits the predecessor's credential owner.

_Avoid_: retry, re-run, task restart.

### Deployment Action Actor

The Workspace Actor who initiates a Deployment Task or performs a collaborative action on it, such as cancellation, Blocking Input submission, or Redeploy. It describes who acted; it never transfers or replaces the task's Deployment Credential Binding.

_Avoid_: credential owner, task owner.

### Deployment Credential Binding

The immutable selection on a GitHub Deployment Task identifying the credential-owning Workspace Actor, that actor's GitHub Connection reference, and the binding version chosen at task creation. Collaborative actions never change it, and Redeploy resolves a new binding from its own initiator.

### Deployment Task Retention

The split lifecycle boundary between permanent Deployment Task history and its ephemeral execution runtime. Deployment Task rows, events, runner transcripts, and deployment results have no application-level retention deletion. A per-task Deploy Devbox is paused at a terminal outcome and deleted after 24 confirmed paused hours; the task then records `runtimeState=deleted`. There is no user-facing task deletion.

_Avoid_: task purge, clear history, archive task, Devbox retention as task retention.

### GitHub Connection

A personal OAuth authorization that lets one Workspace Actor list and deploy from their own GitHub repositories within a namespace — never a shared namespace credential another actor may select. Disconnecting forgets the connection locally; the GitHub-side authorization survives until revoked on GitHub, and account choice happens at connect time, never at disconnect.

_Avoid_: shared namespace GitHub credential.

### Docker Deployment Settings

The creation-time choices for a new AP before it exists: Docker image, launch command and arguments, environment, AP Configuration Files, AP Storage Mounts, App Listening Port, and whether to request a Platform Address. Independent of entry path; user-facing surfaces use Public Address or Network language, not Ingress language.

### DB Deployment Settings

The creation-time choices for a new DB before it exists — database engine, instance preset, and replica count. Independent of entry path: with a new Project or added to an existing one.

### Deployment Task Projection

A Project-scoped read-side view of one Deployment Task containing only the facts project surfaces need to present progress and resource handoff: its Deployment Projection Slots and Deployment Preview Edges. Project Canvas consumes projections rather than full task records, and a projection does not own Canvas Layout positions.

### Deployment Projection Slot

A task-local Project Canvas slot within one Deployment Task Projection: unknown while progress precedes structured result evidence, concrete once it carries the anticipated result identity used for Deployment Handoff — which is still not a Canvas Resource Identity. Only anticipated results that can become canvas resource nodes get slots; template support objects do not.

### Deployment Projection Footprint

The visual group of currently visible slots for one Deployment Task Projection — possibly AP, DB, AP Public Access Node, and template-visible workload slots from the same task. Each AP Public Access Node slot stays visually paired with its owning AP slot; the pairing guides generated placement and never overrides user-arranged placements.

### Deployment Projection Placement

The temporary, project-scoped visual position a Deployment Projection Slot owns before Deployment Handoff — a Canvas Layout placement that may be rekeyed to the resulting resource. A user-arranged placement is authoritative; a generated one is a system proposal refinable until a user arranges it.

### Deployment Placeholder Node

A temporary Project Canvas skeleton node for a Deployment Projection Slot without a live resource node. A task projection — not a resource, Settings Owner, action target, or Canvas Connection endpoint.

_Avoid_: ghost node, pending AP, pending DB.

### Deployment Preview Edge

A temporary visual relationship between slots of one Deployment Task Projection, requiring explicit preview facts such as generated AP-to-DB reference intent, template-declared dependency, or AP-to-public-access pairing — sharing one task is not enough. Not a Canvas Connection.

### Deployment Handoff

The transition where a concrete slot stops being a Deployment Placeholder Node and its matching result appears as a normal resource node, possibly rekeying the slot's placement to the resource when it has no existing position; it completes per slot while unresolved slots stay visible. When multiple slots offer incompatible placements to the same unplaced resource and no user-arranged placement unambiguously outranks the rest, task order decides nothing: the resource takes First Canvas Placement and the conflicting placements are consumed.

### Deployment Result Resource

A user-visible Project result a Deployment Task creates or changes — an AP, DB, AP-owned Public Address, or template-visible workload. Support objects may explain progress but are never result resources.

_Avoid_: applied object, Kubernetes object.

### Deployment Result Readiness

The condition where a task's user-visible result resources have become healthy enough for the task to count as complete — distinct from having applied Deployment Artifacts.

_Avoid_: apply complete, manifest applied.

### Deployment Timeline Step

A runner-defined user-facing step in a Deployment Task Timeline. One step may summarize several execution phases, and its identity stays stable throughout a run even as status, events, or result details change.

_Avoid_: backend phase, task status.

### Deployment Task Timeline

The user-facing progress view for one Deployment Task: runner-defined Deployment Timeline Steps plus Deployment Result Resource Cards once results are known. It belongs to the task, not a browser session or chat transcript.

### Deployment Result Resource Card

A Deployment Task Timeline section for one Deployment Result Resource, presenting its status and events within the task's progress. Blocked means the task can still proceed after an external action or changed condition; failed means the current run has ended for that resource. Required cards gate Deployment Result Readiness; optional cards may keep showing progress or warnings without blocking completion.

### Deployment Failure Reason

The stable classification and corresponding user-facing action shown on a failed Deployment Timeline Step — the narrowest reason the engine can prove, `unknown` with the Task ID otherwise; safe to persist and aggregate, never a raw stack trace. Its expandable diagnostic context (Deployment Failure Detail) shows the scrubbed provider or Kubernetes error for direct/template runners, and for the AI runner only allowlisted fields — never a raw Gateway or command error.

### Deployment Task Dock

A Project Canvas affordance presenting the current Project's visible Deployment Task Projections so users notice active or attention-needing deployment work and re-enter each task's Deployment Task Timeline. Chips carry no inline lifecycle actions — cancel and Redeploy live in the timeline pane a chip opens; terminal tasks additionally offer dismissal. Not deployment history, a task center, or a canvas node.

### Deployment Task Dock Dismissal

A personal acknowledgement of one Deployment Task Projection version in the dock, available only for terminal tasks. It suppresses that task's reminder for that user until the projection changes — not shared Project state, cancellation, or deletion.

_Avoid_: close task, delete task, mark complete.

## Project Runtime & Read Model

### Project Runtime

The Project-scoped read-side boundary project surfaces use to interpret current resource presentation facts and session-local launch context. Its Project Resource Read Model is presentation knowledge — never raw resource truth, Canvas Layout, editable Settings backing, or a resource action command bus.

### Settings Launch Context

Session-local Project Runtime memory of how one project surface entry was opened, carrying launch source and transient bridge intent for the current browser session only. Not route state or editable Settings backing: it may disappear without changing the restored Settings Owner or Settings View, and route restoration never restores bridge intent.

## Project Canvas

### Project Canvas Workbench

The single module that orchestrates the Project Canvas page — its actions, canvas, and surfaces — and is the test surface for that orchestration.

### Container Node

A canvas node that represents an AP workload. The name is retained as a product/UI term; it does not mean an individual Kubernetes container.

### Canvas Resource Identity

The product identity of a canvas node's backing AP, DB, or AP Public Access Node surface, keyed by `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` so Canvas Layout stays stable across short reconciliation gaps. Kubernetes UID is retained only as last-seen entity identity to detect when a same-named workload is meaningfully new; AP Public Access Nodes use AP-bound identity rather than their own UID.

### Canvas Layout

The Project-scoped visual arrangement of the canvas, shared by everyone who opens the Project — the single authoritative placement store, keyed by Canvas Placement Owners rather than rendered node instances. A resource-owned placement survives transient read-model absence for a grace window (Missing Resource Layout Grace); only continuous absence beyond it may remove the placement.

### Canvas Placement Owner

The stable Project Canvas identity that owns one visual placement — a real resource or a Deployment Task projection. Both kinds live in the same Canvas Layout, and a deployment-owned placement does not make the projection a resource.

### Incremental Canvas Placement

The placement rule for canvas items without a Canvas Layout position: it proposes a deterministic Generated Canvas Position, preferring anchors that reflect resource relationships before global open space, and saves only the newly placed nodes. Nodes from one user workflow or with direct relationship evidence are placed together as a group, without binding their later movement. A user-created or user-moved placement (User Canvas Placement) is authoritative over generated placement, Deployment Handoff, and this rule; existing positions are never recalculated — this is not whole-canvas auto-layout. First Canvas Placement, the first persisted position for an owner, is used only when neither a resource-owned nor an inheritable deployment-owned placement exists.

### Canvas Viewport Focus

A temporary, per-view viewport adjustment that keeps a target canvas node visible within the currently available canvas area (excluding covering surfaces such as a Side Pane) without changing Canvas Layout. Deployment task focus is one-shot — on explicit task re-entry or a focus target's first appearance; routine timeline streaming must not keep moving the user's viewport.

### Canvas Connection

A canvas edge representing an established runtime dependency between resources, derived from saved resource state. Removing Database Binding evidence in an unsaved AP Environment draft does not remove or hide an established connection before the update succeeds.

### Connecting Edge

A temporary canvas interaction created when a user drags a line between canvas nodes. It becomes a domain command only when its endpoints match a supported resource relationship, regardless of drag direction.

## Resource Actions & Affordances

### Resource Action

A user-triggered command that changes an existing AP or DB resource's state — start, stop, restart, delete, toggling DB public access. It belongs to the target resource, not the Project Canvas or the surface that launched it.

_Avoid_: Canvas Action, node action.

### Resource Surface Intent

A user-triggered intent to open a resource-focused project surface for an existing AP or DB — Resource Logs, AP Terminal, DB Terminal, DB Access, or a Settings View. It belongs to surface orchestration, not the resource lifecycle; it is not a Resource Action because no resource state changes.

### Resource Affordance

A user-facing entry point fronting either a Resource Action or a Resource Surface Intent, belonging to the target resource rather than the surface showing it. Each target kind has a stable affordance family — mutually exclusive lifecycle entries resolve by resource state, and kinds without an established family gain no placeholder entries for menu parity.

### Unavailable Resource Affordance

A Resource Affordance that applies to the target conceptually but cannot be used in the current project, session, resource state, or platform capability. It stays visible with a user-facing reason in product terms (read-only access, busy resource state, unsupported capability, missing configuration, …) rather than being hidden; it is not a placeholder for unshipped roadmap capability.

_Avoid_: hidden unsupported action, missing menu item.

## Project Surfaces

### Side Pane

A non-modal, temporary project surface for focused work such as resource inspection, settings, or deployment flows — distinct from the persistent Project Assistant Pane. Its pinned footer carries pane-level actions chosen by the hosted surface, not by the pane; a surface without pane-level actions has none.

### Main Action Surface

A temporary project surface occupying the project main area for focused resource work — not a right-side inspection surface like a Side Pane.

### Session Drawer

A bottom temporary project surface for one interactive resource session, such as an AP Terminal or DB Terminal. It may stay open while the user inspects details in a Side Pane.

### Project Assistant Pane

The persistent right-side project layout region hosting assistant chat and related controls. It can trigger Side Panes but is not itself a Side Pane.

## Sessions & Observability

### AP Terminal

An interactive terminal session that opens a generic pod shell on an AP workload — a workload shell, unlike the DB Terminal's database engine-client session.

_Avoid_: AP Console, console.

### DB Terminal

An interactive session running a DB Service's native engine client — `psql`, `mysql`, `mongosh`, `redis-cli` — for ad-hoc read-write commands. Distinct from DB Access's structured workflow; usable only while the service runs and only for engines with a supported client, otherwise presented as an Unavailable Resource Affordance rather than omitted.

_Avoid_: DB Console, console.

### Resource Logs

A read-only Main Action Surface for timestamped runtime output of one AP or DB Service — observation, not interactive commands. Always in exactly one of two states: a Live Log Window, anchored to the present and following new output across the trailing relative span, or a Frozen Log Window, anchored to fixed wall-clock bounds that never move — entered by pausing (which materializes the bounds) or applying an absolute range, and always described by its actual start and end.

### Workload Telemetry Series

A normalized time series of workload resource usage for AP and DB workloads, presented in metrics panels only as a live trailing window whose leading edge is the present — unlike Resource Logs there is no frozen counterpart. Its latest-point summary (Workload Telemetry Snapshot) feeds compact node presentation and is observational data, not lifecycle state or canvas topology.

_Avoid_: frozen metrics window, custom metrics range.

### Workload Telemetry Authorization

The access decision for workload telemetry: a caller may read a workload's telemetry only if it can read that workload's backing object under its own credentials — per workload, not per namespace; a parseable kubeconfig is never sufficient. A denial is indistinguishable from an absent workload, so it never reveals whether another tenant's workload exists.

_Avoid_: namespace access check, metrics permission.

## Assistant & Billing

### Assistant Conversation

A private assistant chat thread scoped to a namespace and owned by the Workspace Actor who started it. Ownership is an enforced authorization boundary fixed at creation; a foreign conversation is indistinguishable from a missing one. Personal, unlike namespace-shared Canvas Layouts and Deployment Tasks.

_Avoid_: shared namespace chat, per-namespace chat history.

### Chat Billing Mode

Who pays for one assistant model call: `free` spends a Free Chat Turn while turns remain and a platform model is configured, otherwise `user` bills the caller's AI Proxy — decided per turn, with the handoff automatic. The mode, not the remaining count, is the reliable signal of being charged: a namespace with no platform model bills `user` from its first turn with turns unspent.

_Avoid_: subscription tier, plan.

### Free Chat Turns

A platform-funded allowance of assistant turns per namespace, consumed only after a turn completes successfully. An entitlement counter, not a rate limit — and a shared workspace grant, not a per-user entitlement.

_Avoid_: free tier, trial credits.

### AI Proxy

The per-cluster, OpenAI-compatible gateway (Sealos `aiproxy`) serving user-billed assistant turns against the user's own cluster account — distinct from its `aiproxy-web` token-management sibling. A `user`-billed turn calls it with an AI Proxy Token, a user-scoped API key minted from the caller's kubeconfig that authorizes and bills that one user; the token is neither a platform credential nor the kubeconfig itself.

_Avoid_: model provider, LLM backend, system token, platform key.

## Onboarding

### Onboarding Profile

The per-person survey record captured by the first-entry sampling dialog
(the user understanding loop). An Onboarding Profile belongs to the bare
global `userUid` — Brain's only namespace-less personal resource — so one
person holds at most one profile per region, regardless of workspaces
(ADR-0061).

_Avoid_: first-login record, workspace profile, per-workspace survey, user cohort row.

### Sampled

The terminal predicate on an Onboarding Profile: a person is Sampled once a
completed or dismissed record exists, and the sampling dialog never shows
again. Anything short of a terminal record — including an abandoned
mid-survey attempt — leaves the person Unsampled, and the predicate is
re-judged on every entry.

_Avoid_: has logged in before, first-login flag, seen-dialog cookie, survey done.

### Terminal Snapshot

The full set of confirmed answers a survey session carries on its terminal
action (submit or skip), making the resulting Sampled record complete on
its own — it never depends on the per-step best-effort saves having
survived. Only answers the person confirmed by advancing are part of the
snapshot; an unconfirmed selection or unsubmitted draft is not. A snapshot
never erases previously saved answers it does not itself carry.

_Avoid_: final sync, answer replay, batched answers, form dump.

### Onboarding Gate

The client-side judgment that decides whether the sampling dialog appears
for the current person. The Gate is opportunistic and non-blocking: the
console always renders, and the dialog appears only on a definitive
Unsampled verdict. Any unknown outcome — credentials never arriving, a
failed or unresolved status check — means the Gate silently stands down
until the next entry. Sampling is never bought at the cost of console
access.

_Avoid_: login wall, blocking splash, mandatory interstitial, onboarding redirect.

### Cohort Tag

The stable machine-readable enum value recorded for a survey answer (e.g.
`real_business`), decoupled from display copy so a copy revision never
splits a cohort. Only first-order answers — what the person actually
selected or typed — are recorded as Cohort Tags; derived interpretations
(business intent, company context) are read-time computations and are never
stored.

_Avoid_: raw answer text, display label, derived segment column, business intent field.

## Design System

### Component Registry

An internal catalog for reusable UI components in the product design system — not complete product surfaces, panes, or workflows. A Registry Component may carry product vocabulary but must be driven by a host surface and must not own a complete product workflow or settings lifecycle.

_Avoid_: Pane Registry, Flow Registry.
